Go to : Accesing request data on quick start on Flask webpage
Link:   https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#accessing-request-data

_____Copy codes under "The Request Object"_____

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if valid_login(request.form['username'],
                       request.form['password']):
            return log_the_user_in(request.form['username'])
        else:
            error = 'Invalid username/password'
    # the code below is executed if the request method
    # was GET or the credentials were invalid
    return render_template('login.html', error=error)
		
____Remove the following from the codes (line 3 up to the second last line)_____

error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if valid_login(request.form['username'],
                       request.form['password']):
            return log_the_user_in(request.form['username'])
        else:
            error = 'Invalid username/password'
    # the code below is executed if the request method
    # was GET or the credentials were invalid


GET means the browser wants us to send information
POST means the browser wants us to save the information
